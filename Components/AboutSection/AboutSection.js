                        The Sweet Spot is a bold new beginning and comeback for Akron, Ohio sublings Maddie and Angelo Indr√©.
                        After their band fell apart last year, Maddie spent the summer touring as a merch girl unsure of her next move regarding her own band.
                        Days spent on the tour bus sparked inspiration, and a brand new vision was born. Songs started pouring out, and in between tours, she would take them to Angelo, and they would spend hours recording demo after demo.

                        When things fall apart, it can be looked at as a stopping point or a chance to create.
                        A chance to start again and make it exactly how you want it.
                        This is a new era.
