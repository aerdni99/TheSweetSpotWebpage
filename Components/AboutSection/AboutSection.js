                Man Who Loves Rock and Roll: <br />
                Excuse me miss, I'm looking for a place to lay my head for the evening... <br />
                its been quite a long day on the road. <br /><br />

                Front Desk Lady: <br />
                You're in luck sir! Well, partially in luck. <br />
                You see, there isn't much laying down at this establishment. <br />
                However, you can stay all evening long. <br />
                In fact, you can stay for the rest of your life!<br />
                Hope you brought your sleaziest pair of pants and your positive mental attitude.<br />
                Welcome to the Sweet Spot! <br />
                Here at the Sweet Spot, we offer 5-star Rock & Roll...<br />
                ...and not much of anything else. <br /><br />

                Man Who Loves Rock and Roll: <br />
                Where do I put my bags?ðŸ¤
