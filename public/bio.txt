Excuse me miss, I'm looking for a place to lay my head for the evening... its been quite a long day on the road.

You're in luck sir! Well, partially in luck. You see, there isn't much laying down at this establishment. However, you can stay all evening long. In fact, you can stay for the rest of your life!
Hope you brought your sleaziest pair of pants and your positive mental attitude.
Welcome to the Sweet Spot! Here at the Sweet Spot, we offer 5-star Rock & Roll, and not much of anything else. 

Where do I put my bags?
