# 🎸 The Sweet Spot — Band Website

[thesweetspot.band](thesweetspot.band)

A dynamic and responsive web experience for my indie rock band, **The Sweet Spot**. I play keys, sing backup vocals, and built this site to help promote our music and connect with fans.

This project is built using modern web technologies and serves as both a public-facing promotional page and a simple admin portal for managing bookings.
